First I am creating a three dimensional array and getting the inputs from the user.
Then A single dimensional array is used to get the Seat Numbers

Then I am traversing through each and every seat numbers and check for the condition to position the passengers.

These conditions were written in a separate function named AirplaneFuntions.py

I made a function to check for prime as isPrime and function to check for is multiple of 2 pow n as isMul2n.
I will be checking for the availability of Aisle , Window and Middle seats in their respective orders.

After checking all these conditions , The passengers were alloted their seats.
